## A fork of plv8 intending to add commonjs require and updated livescript support

### CREDITS
  * tracking http://code.google.com/p/plv8js
  * adapted changes from https://github.com/JerrySievert/plv8 to get require working on latest plv8js

### ROADMAP
  * update livescript support
  * allow modules folder to have native livescript (if not too difficult) instead of requiring them to be compiled down to js files
